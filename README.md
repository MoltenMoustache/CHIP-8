# Josh Moten's CHIP-8 Interpreter
This is my own personal implementation of a CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter, based in C++.
I thought it would be a fun, small project, to create this emulator purely off of [this guide by Tobias V. Langhoff](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator) and no code samples.

SDL3 was fully release a week or so before I started this project, so I also made use of that for the basic graphics, window and input implementations.
