# Josh Moten's CHIP-8 Interpreter
## CHIP-8
[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is an interpreted programming language developed in 1978 for an 1802 microprocessor. It was used in consoles like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800.

## This Project
This is my own personal implementation of a CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter, based in C++.
I thought it would be a fun, small project, to create this emulator purely off of [this guide by Tobias V. Langhoff](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator) and no code samples (outside of some SDL stuff).

SDL3 was fully released a week or so before I started this project, so I also made use of that for the basic graphics, window and input implementations.
